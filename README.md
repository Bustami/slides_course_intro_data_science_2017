This repo contains the first version of slides that i used to teach course "Introduction to Data Science" using RStudio in [EstaciÃ³n Lastarria Cowork](www.estacionlastarria.cl) in 2017-2018 (Spanish).

The course was splitted into 4 parts: 
1) Introduction + Data fundamentals
2) Loading and Processing
3) Exploratory analysis + Visualization
4) Modelling and Reporting

I used different resources and references, but mainly material and contents from data science diplomas of [Universidad de Chile](https://www.dcc.uchile.cl/node/1681) and [Universidad Del Desarrollo](https://ingenieria.udd.cl/ver-diplomado/diplomado-en-data-science-2/)

Disclaimer: Currently i recommend to learn "tidyverse" and pipelines (%>%) before than base R.

This repo contains the first version of slides that i used to teach course "Introduction to Data Science" using RStudio in (Estaci√≥n Lastarria)[www.estacionlastarria.cl] in 2017.

The course was splitted into 4 parts: 
1) Introduction + Data fundamentals
2) Loading and Processing
3) Exploratory analysis + Visualization
4) Modelling and Reporting

I used different resources and references, but mainly material and contents from data science diplomas of Universidad de Chile and Universidad Del Desarrollo
